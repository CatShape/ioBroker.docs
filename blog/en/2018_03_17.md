The new cloud adapter version has been prepared.
<!-- SOURCE: 877194 Es wurde die neue Cloud-Adapter-Version vorbereitet. -->

It is important that ALL have this version when the cloud server restarts next time (in a week).
<!-- SOURCE: 830292 Es ist wichtig, dass ALLE diese Version haben, wenn der Cloud-Server nächtes mal neu gestartet wird (in einer Woche). -->

This applies to iobroker.net and also to iobroker.pro. However, iobroker.pro will be updated about a week after iobroker.net.

## What's changed?
<!-- SOURCE: 163484 ## What's changed? -->
Cloud adapter now supports control commands from cloud server.
<!-- SOURCE: 322795 Cloud-Adapter unterstützt jetzt die Steuerungsbefehle vom Cloud-Server. -->

There are 3 types of cloud commands:
<!-- SOURCE: 700672 Es gibt 3 Arten von Cloud-Befehlen: -->

### 1. "Redirect".
<!-- SOURCE: 914365 ### 1. "Redirect". -->
Since iobroker.net is burdened with many outdated clients, the cloud server can now redirect the new clients to the new address 10557 and isolate the old clients.
<!-- SOURCE: 70312 Since iobroker.net is burdened with many outdated clients, the cloud server can now redirect the new clients to the new address 10557 and isolate the old clients. -->

The old clients will continue to burden the old server 10555, but there will be a new, faster server that only checks the versions. This can save about 30 connections per second (!).

Also future moves and load-balancing will be possible.
<!-- SOURCE: 726863 Also future moves and load-balancing will be possible. -->

### 2. "Stop".
<!-- SOURCE: 225461 ### 2. "Stop". -->
Cloud Server can now send a "stop" command to clients that do not have the appropriate version. This stops the clients and stops loading the server.

Client is disconnected until it is updated.
<!-- SOURCE: 333148 Client is disconnected until it is updated. -->

Unfortunately, the command is not supported in older clients (<2.5.0) and therefore there is the server migration trick.

But in the future it will be easier.

### 3. "Wait".
<!-- SOURCE: 217781 ### 3. "Wait". -->
At startup, the cloud server receives VERY many timely connection requests. Since the database can not process so many requests at the same time, the clients are requested to wait 60-90 seconds and 500 or 1000 clients are connected at the same time.

So the server can handle all requests in peace, without having a "rocking effect".

## "Upswing Effect"
<!-- SOURCE: 339790 ## "Upswing Effect" -->
Many clients are connected and the server slows down. The clients lose the connection and immediately start connecting again (parallel to the existing one). This doubles the number of connections until the server is completely overloaded. Such a condition can take up to 5 hours.
