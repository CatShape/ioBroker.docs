## JS controller 4.0.24 and Node.js 18: An update is worthwhile
<!-- SOURCE: 909729 ## JS controller 4.0.24 and Node.js 18: An update is worthwhile -->
The latest version of the JS controller, version 4.0.24, improves compatibility with Node.js 18. It still prefers IPv4 addresses, which has changed in Node.js 18. Additionally, Node.js 18 will become the recommended version as Node.js 14 and 16 will reach their End of Life later this year. This is an important step to ensure the stability and security of your system.

In this context, you should also update the info adapter if you are still using it.

## Status Matter: Exciting times are upon us!
<!-- SOURCE: 391572 ## Status Matter: Exciting times are upon us! -->
The integration of the new smart home standard Matter is progressing. There will be both a controller and a bridge adapter. This means that both Matter devices can be controlled directly and ioBroker devices can be used as a bridge for other controllers such as Apple Home, Google Home or Alexa for local control via a hub. However, there is still a lot of work to be done and it will still be a few weeks before an alpha version is available. Matter is very much based on UDP and some (e.g. Google) also require IPv6 support in the network. So it will be interesting in terms of subnets, VLANs and Docker. We see details when we have something. Who would like to support - be it in the development or also later with documentation etc. - please contact Apollon77!

Work on vis 2.x is also progressing, but there is still a lot to do. With iobroker.vis-2-widgets-jaeger-design we present a special widget that will be commercially available. It enables you to create views for the smart home with simple configuration and is extensively configurable.
