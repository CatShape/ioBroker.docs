**This documentation is the central reference for all ioBroker users:**

## Page structure
This page has been created in a ***responsive design***. This means that depending on the resolution of the reader's display (PC/tablet/mobile) it will be displayed differently for optimal readability.

In the case of low (effective) resolutions, some control elements are also hidden to make room for the main window.

It is therefore quite possible that the current display differs from the screenshots.

### Different menus
In order to get the best possible overview, there are three different menus:

![side menus](../../de/intro/media/Seite_numbers.png)

---

#### 1 - Main Menu
The main items of this menu are usually visible on the PC in the title bar of the page, the entire menu is hidden at low resolutions.
Then it must be opened by clicking on the burger icon:

![side menu](../../de/intro/media/Hauptmenu.png)

After clicking on a menu item, the menu closes automatically to make more space for the content.

---

#### 2 - Docu menu This menu is usually visible on the PC, but is hidden at low resolutions. Then it must be opened by clicking on the burger icon:
![Document menu](../../de/intro/media/Dokumenu.png)

There is a filter field in the top line. By entering a term, the entire menu tree is filtered according to this term and only suitable menu items are displayed.

The menu can be hidden again using the icon with the arrow to make more space for the content.

---

#### 3 - Theme Menu
In this menu, the main topics of the selected article are displayed in order to be able to navigate more quickly to the point you are looking for.

![themed menu](../../de/intro/media/Themenmenu.png)

The menu can be hidden again using the icon with the **X**.

### More controls
#### 4 - Language selection
The website is multilingual. More languages will be added gradually. Some are generated automatically first, native speakers are invited to improve the texts.

The desired language can be selected on the globe icon.

![language selection](../../de/intro/media/Languages.png)

This language list will be expanded as needed.

#### 5 - Search
This field needs no explanation. Please use extensively!
