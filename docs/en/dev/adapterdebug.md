# Debug adapters
## Debug adapters with Chrome
Node.JS supports debugging with Chrome.

If you stop an adapter in ioBroker and then start it from the console (CLI) like this:

```
cd /opt/iobroker
iobroker stop sayit
node --inspect node_modules/iobroker.sayit/main.js --debug
```

Important is `-â€“inspect`

Then something like this is output:

```
Debugger listening on port 9229.
Warning: This is an experimental feature and could change at any time.
To start debugging, open the following URL in Chrome:
    chrome-devtools://devtools/remote/serve_file/@60cd6e859b9f557d2312f5bf532f6aec5f284980/inspector.html?experiments=true&v8only=true&ws=127.0.0.1:9229/9415dda6-0825-40ed-855c-83c6142e56e9
2016-12-27 15:23:02.637  - error: sayit.0 adapter disabled
starting. Version 1.3.1 in /opt/iobroker/node_modules/iobroker.sayit, node: v6.9.2
2016-12-27 15:23:02.647  - info: sayit.0 starting. Version 1.3.1 in /opt/iobroker/node_modules/iobroker.sayit, node: v6.9.2
Debugger attached.
```

After that you can debug with Chrome by typing the link in Chrome:

![Chrome](../../de/dev/media/adapterdebug1.png)

*Tested: Windows, Chrome 55, node.js 6.9.2*

### Remote debugging with Chrome
If iobroker is not running on the same machine as the Chrome browser, then the command is based on the example above:

```
node --inspect-brk=0.0.0.0:9229 node_modules/iobroker.sayit/main.js --debug
```

the parameter `--inspect-brk` ensures, compared to above,

that a breakpoint is set on the first line of your adapter right at the start of the debugger.

If you don't always want to copy the link to start the debug individually, you can also call up the following page in chrome:

```
chrome://inspect
```

then enter the IP address and port of your **ioBroker computer** once via Configuration exactly as with the Inspect command.

The debug session is then displayed there after the start of the command and can be started with one click.

The Chrome debugging capabilities are fantastic.
You have all the options that you know from **web debugging**: breakpoints, also with conditions, `watch`, `call stack`, `scope inspection`, console output, etc.

Pictures and English description can be found in [here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/xdk/articles/using-chrome-devtools-to-debug-your-remote-iot-nodejs-application).

If it is not yet installed, the node-inspector is required on the ioBroker computer:

```
npm install -g node-inspector
```

Normally the node-inspector is automatically installed with the ioBroker.

## Debugging with WebStorm
## Debug with `Visual Studio Code`
If you open a directory with `VS Code`, then after you open adapter directory (`File=>Open folder...` menu), you can then debug an adapter.

The configuration in the `.vscode/launch.js` file should look like this:

```
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Program",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}\\main.js",
            "args": ["--debug"]
        },
        {
            "name": "Attach to Process",
            "type": "node",
            "request": "attach",
            "address": "IO_BROKER_IP_ADDRESS",
            "port": 9229
          }
    ]
}
```

### Local debugging
After the adapter is stopped (`iobroker stop ADAPTER_NAME`), you can start the adapter in VS Code: ![VS code](../../de/dev/media/adapterdebug10.png)

After selecting `Launch Program` and clicking `Play` button, the adapter is started and you can debug locally.

### Remote debugging
For this you should start the adapter on the ioBroker server specifically.

```
d /opt/iobroker
obroker stop ADAPTERNAME
ode --inspect-brk=0.0.0.0:9229 node_modules/iobroker.ADAPTERNAME/main.js --debug
```

Afterwards one can connect `VS Code` to process (`attach`).
