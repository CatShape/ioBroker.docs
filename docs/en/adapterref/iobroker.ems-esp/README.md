## Bosch / Buderus heating systems with km200 / IP-inside and/or ems-esp interface 

The adapter supports an interface towards the heating systems from Bosch Group using EMS or EMS+ bus. 
(Buderus / Junkers / Netfit etc). 

## It can interface towards the heating system with use of Web-API calls toward:

* km200, km200 hrv, km100, km50, HMC300 or IP-inside (from Bosch Group) 
* ems-esp interface (https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32) with latest dev version (see below) and the ESP32 chip. 
* The old ESP8266 gateways with API V2 are supported until this version as well.

The ems-esp adapter can read and write data to both gateways to steer all heating components. 
It can be used either for the original Bosch-group gateways or the ems-esp or both in parallel.

The adapter is tested for the ems-esp gateway with latest firmware versions of ESP32 >= v3.3.1. 
Old systems with an ESP 8266 are only supported until this adapter version.

## important settings in EMS-ESP:

* API V2: MQTT Settings have to be boolean format 1/0 !
* API V3: Formatting Options for Boolean Format has to be 1/0 and for Enum Format Number 
* The Enable API write commands settings within ems-esp has to be enabled 
* Bypass Access Token authorization on API calls has to be set or the token has to be entered.

While selecting the checkbox either km200-like device structure is used for ems-esp datafields or the original EMS-ESP device view is kept: boiler, thermostat, mixer etc. When using the km200 gateway in parallel it is recommended to use the km200 data structure. Then all entities / states are within same location within ioBroker's object structure.

## polling

This adapter reads after start values from ems-esp and km200 by http get requests and is capable to subscribe on state changes and send the respective http (post) commands back to either ems-esp hardware or the km200 gateway. 

* EMS-ESP read polling is a parameter (standard 60 secs) and can not be set below 15 seconds.
* KM200 polling is a parameter (standard 300 secs) too and minimum value which can be set is 90 seconds.
* km200 recordings (energy consumption and temperature statistics) are updated every hour
 
## km200 

The web-api calls toward/from the km200 gateway is encrypted. For the en-/decryption there are two passords needed:

* the gateway password on an albel on the gateway in the form: xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx (case sensitive)
* the private password set by using the Buderus **MyDevice** App (do not use myBuderus or similar apps !) 

The fields to be used could be defined by polling the km200-structure (*) or the respective csv-file within the adapter instance parameters. 

For 1st adapter start it is recommended to use a "*" to select all km200 data-fields.
The adapter then creates a km200.csv file within ../iobroker-data/ems-esp/{instance} directory.

This file can be used for next start of adapter-instance.
Not needed lines (fields) can be deleted to reduce the number of km200-fields to be read. (Make a copy & rename the file) 

## km200 recordings (energy and temperature statistics)

Most modern heating systems have an ip-inside gateway and support energy statistics:

* recording for power consumptions and temperature statistics
* For these systems and where this recordings data is available the respective statistics are polled and stored in states. 
Available are hourly, dayly and monthly statistics and stored as array data in states and if an db-instance is selected as well in states filled with db-entries.(statenames start with "_")
* The checkbox recordings has to be enabled and the database instance (mySQL or InfluxDB) has to be defined. SQL or InfluxDB History adapter need to be installed and active to use this option.
* the original recording data read by web-api calls are stored under statestructure km200.
* DB-statistics to be shown in flot graphs or grafana are only available yet for mySQL and InfluxDB databases.
* For InfluxDB V1 the retention policy has to be set to a minimum of 170 weeks. (alter retention policy global on iobroker duration 170w;)

This adapter then creates the respective recording states, enables sql statistics and writes historic database entries using sql commands and is updating the recordings. 
Update frequency is every hour. 

## km200 recordings - an explanation

Some field-values are set as "recordable". These fields will then have "recordings".
Depending on the type of heating system these recordings are stored under  recordings/... or energyMonitoring/...

For recorded states every minute a sample is collected within the km200 gateway. 
An hourly value should have 60 samples, a daily 24*60=1440 samples, a monthly 1440 x #days. 
Every timeperiod has to be read within the adapter by 3 api-calls:

* Hourly values: today, yesterday, day before yesterday
* Daily values: actual month, last months, month -2
* Monthly values: actual year, last year, year -2

Within the read data-field by web-api the sum of sample-values is stored within y-value, no of samples within c-value.
(see original values within json-data in km200... fields.)

Since sometimes samples are missing the value has to be interpolated.
For some months (> 12 months ago) some data might be missing. (Bosch errors within code?)

For the actual months energy consumption the adapter calculates the sum of daily values and uses this sum to get more accurate data.


## statistics

Boiler statistics can be enabled showing:
* The polling cycle processing time for ems-esp and/or km200 gateway reads and state processing 
* The number of boiler & ww starts per hour / 24 hours 
* Boiler utilization per hour (0-100%).
* An active database instance (see above) is needed to calculate the statistics.

## boiler efficiency 

Boiler efficiency can be calculated if parameters are filled. (Gas- and Oilboilers only)

* The boiler efficiency can be calculated based on average boiler temp: (boiler temp + return temp) / 2.
* When return temp is not available in km200 the return temp is calculated with boilertemp -10 Â°C when no ems-esp is available. 
* Look at the datasheet of your boiler to adjust the efficiency table accordingly. 

## changes in state-structure

Whenever a new EMS-ESP firmware adds new datafields and/or changes datafield names they are processed during adapter run. Nevertheless obsolete datafields are not deleted automatically by the adapter. 
There is an option to re-build the state-structure by deleting states on adapter re-start (states with history / db entries are kept)
