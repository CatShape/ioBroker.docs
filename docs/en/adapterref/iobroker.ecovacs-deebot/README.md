This adapter uses the [ecovacs-deebot.js](https://github.com/mrbungle64/ecovacs-deebot.js) library.

## Features

Some noteworthy features are:

* Basic cleaning functions (e.g. auto clean, spot area, custom area)
* and various other commands (e.g. play sound, reset consumables, relocate position)
* Retrieve basic information (e.g. battery level, cleaning log, consumable, cleaning and charging status)
* and various extended information (e.g. charging position, map related information, network information)
* Retrieve information during the cleaning process (e.g. current position and current spot area)
* Set vacuum power, water level and other basic settings
* Set extended settings (e.g. continuous cleaning, do-not-disturb mode, volume, TrueDetect 3D)
* Save the last used custom area and rerun the saved areas
* Retrieve information of the maps incl. spot areas, virtual boundaries and no-mop-zones
* Delete, save and recreate single virtual boundaries as well as a full set of virtual boundaries
* Information about the date and time of the last presence for each single spot area
* Some functionality when returning to charging station or entering/leaving spot area
* Function for loading the current map image
* Set individual spot area names (in ioBroker)

Please note: Some features are only available for some models and some are still experimental

## Models

### Fully supported models

The fully supported models are those that I own myself:

* Deebot OZMO 920
* Deebot T8 AIVI

### Other supported models

These models should work properly or at least partially.
They are either already known to work or are technically similar to these models.
Nevertheless, the functionality may be partially limited.

I try to achieve a wide range of functionality, but decide this case by case depending on complexity and various other criteria.
There is of course no claim to full functionality.

#### Ecovacs Deebot

* Deebot OZMO 950/T5
* Deebot N8 series
* Deebot U2 series
* Deebot T8 series
* Deebot T9 series
* Deebot T10 series
* Deebot X1 series

#### yeedi (since version 1.4.5, still experimental)

* yeedi k650
* yeedi 2 hybrid
* yeedi vac hybrid
* yeedi mop station

#### Legacy models (soon to be discontinued)

These models use XML for data transport and also different characteristics for commands and events than the current models.
I also don't use my Slim 2, Deebot 901 and OZMO 930 anymore.

**Support for these models will therefore soon be discontinued**.

* Deebot Slim 2
* Deebot N79 series
* Deebot M88
* Deebot 500
* Deebot 600/601/605
* Deebot 710/711
* Deebot 900/901
* Deebot OZMO 610
* Deebot OZMO 900/905
* Deebot OZMO 930
* Deebot OZMO Slim 10/11

## Installation

### Prerequisites

To use this adapter, you will need to already have [ioBroker](iobroker.net) installed. 

The minimum required version of Node.js is 14.x. It is recommended to use version 14.x or 16.x

### Optional prerequisites

This adapter uses the [node-canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas) library for some map-related functionality
which may require the installation of some additional packages.

The installation of canvas is optional and not necessary for models without map functionality, 
but for full functional range please install the following packages.

For Debian-based Linux systems the following commands should be executed:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev librsvg2-dev
```

A reboot might be necessary before executing the next command
```bash
npm install canvas --unsafe-perm=true
```

For instructions for other systems visit https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas#compiling
