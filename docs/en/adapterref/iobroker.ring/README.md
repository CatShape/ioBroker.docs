Requires Admin v4 and `node 16.x`.

The Ring adapter works with Ring devices like the Ring Video Doorbell and Ring Cam and shows if someone rings the
doorbell or if motion is detected. The Ring Video Doorbell or Cam sends a videostream if a motion or doorbell ist
detected.

## Install & Configuration

After installing the Adapter you have to enter your Email and Password of your [ring.com](https://ring.com) Account and
a Token. Ring now requires the use of Two-Factor Auth (2fa) for all accounts. For getting the token please do following
on your shell.

```
npx -p ring-client-api ring-auth-cli
```

or

```
# Unix 
cd /opt/iobroker/node_modules/iobroker.ring/
npm i ring-client-api

cd /opt/iobroker/node_modules/iobroker.ring/node_modules/ring-client-api
node ring-auth-cli
```

You can use special variables for your livestream and snapshot path and filename. These variables will be replaced with
a counter, timestamp, ring id or kind of ring.

* `%d`: Unix timestamp. Example: `test_%d -> test_1588331430061`
* `%i`: ID of your ring device: Example: `test_%i -> test_234567890`
* `%n`: Counter since ring instance start. Example: `test_%n -> test_1`
* `%k`: Kind of your ring device: Example: `test_%k -> test_doorbell`

### FAQ

#### I don't recieve events, snapshots and videos on motion or detected person

Congrats it's very likely that your current token was put on a blacklist by ring, denying you the push notification
youÂ´d need.
Best way to resolve this is to remove any previous browsers/adapter tokens on the ring website and generating a new
token for the adapter.

In order for this adapter to properly react on events Ring must send the push notification to the
used [Ring Api Client](https://github.com/dgreif/ring) for this adapter to react on it. The logic in this adapter was
checked multiple times and works for plenty users, so if you experience issues regarding missing events it's unlikely
the fault of this adapter.

### V3 Rewrite Breaking Changes

1. The Device Names got extended by their description (e.g. from `Device 1234567`
   to `Device 1234567 ("Floodlight Garden")`)
2. Snapshot/Livestream Data is now in a respective channel, containing the other data points.
3. The snapshot/livestream object got changed from type meta to state with type file.
4. Events (Motion, Ding, etc.) are now in a respective channel.
5. Due to `ring-api` dropping the support for node before `v16.x` this adapter needs `node v16.x` or `node v18.x`
6. Active refreshes are reduced to once every 2 hours, as we are listening/reacting on events.

### SIP (before Version 3.x)

You can use the SIP Information for a SIP Video Conference with your SIP client.
The adapter will not provide all ring devices because the used API does not include all ring devices.

You can use for example the Blink SIP client on [http://icanblink.com/](http://icanblink.com/). To get video working go
into Blink's Preferences and under "Accounts", switch the tab to "Media" and deselect "Encrypt audio and video" under "
RTP Options". Be careful the SIP information expire after a few seconds!
Hopefully I will be able to support a video stream soon. Unfortunately [ring.com](https://ring.com) does not have an
official API that support this feature.
If you press the `livestream request` button you get new SIP Information for building up a SIP Video Call session.
If you are using the [ring.com](https://ring.com) cloud you find under history a http link to your last motion /
doorbell recorded video.

### Scripts in `package.json`

Several npm scripts are predefined for your convenience. You can run them using `npm run <scriptname>`
| Script name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `build:ts` | Compile the TypeScript sources. |
| `watch:ts` | Compile the TypeScript sources and watch for changes. |
| `watch` | Shortcut for `npm run watch:ts` |
| `test:ts` | Executes the tests you defined in `*.test.ts` files. |
| `test:package` | Ensures your `package.json` and `io-package.json` are valid. |
| `test:unit` | Tests the adapter startup with unit tests (fast, but might require module mocks to work). |
| `test:integration` | Tests the adapter startup with an actual instance of ioBroker. |
| `test` | Performs a minimal test run on package files and your tests. |
| `check` | Performs a type-check on your code (without compiling anything). |
| `coverage` | Generates code coverage using your test files. |
| `lint` | Runs `ESLint` to check your code for formatting errors and potential bugs. |
| `release` | Creates a new release,
see [`@alcalzone/release-script`](https://github.com/AlCalzone/release-script#usage) for more details. |

### Writing tests

When done right, testing code is invaluable, because it gives you the
confidence to change your code while knowing exactly if and when
something breaks. A good read on the topic of test-driven development
is https://hackernoon.com/introduction-to-test-driven-development-tdd-61a13bc92d92.
Although writing tests before the code might seem strange at first, but it has very
clear upsides.

The template provides you with basic tests for the adapter startup and package files.
It is recommended that you add your own tests into the mix.
