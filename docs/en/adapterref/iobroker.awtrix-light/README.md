# ioBroker.awtrix-light

## Requirements

- nodejs 14.5 (or later)
- js-controller 4.0.15 (or later)
- Admin Adapter 6.6.0 (or later)
- _Awtrix Light_ device with firmware _0.70_ (or later) - e.g. [Ulanzi TC001](https://haus-auto.com/p/ali/UlanziTC001) (Affiliate-Link)

## Getting started

1. Flash the firmware on your device and add it to your WiFi network - see [documentation](https://blueforcer.github.io/awtrix-light/#/quickstart)
2. Install the awtrix-light adapter in ioBroker (and add a new instance)
3. Open the instance configuration and enter the IP address of the device in your local network

## FAQ

**Can I use the adapter to disable the native apps (like battery state and sensor data)?**

No, this feature has been removed in the awtrix light firmware. Please use the on screen menu to hide these apps.

**Is it possible to display boolean values with other text (not true/false)?**

Just create an alias in `alias.0` of type `string` and convert your `boolean` value into any other text with a read function (like `val ? 'open' : 'closed'`). *This is an ioBroker feature and not related to this adapter.*

**How can I update to the latest firmware version?**

Just use the [onscreen menu](https://blueforcer.github.io/awtrix-light/#/onscreen) and navigate to `update`. No need to use the web flasher again.

**The device is getting hot while charging.**

The hardware design is not the best. Please use a power supply which deliveres max. 1A.

**Is it possible to remove the battery from the device?**

Yes, but you have to open the case with a heat gun (since the front glued to the case) and [modify the PCB with a step down converter](https://github.com/Blueforcer/awtrix-light/issues/67#issuecomment-1595418765).

## Same apps on multiple devices

If you have multiple awtrix-light devices, it is required to create a new instance for each device. But it is possible to copy all app settings of another instance if you want to display the same information on all devices. Just select the other instance in the app configuration tab.

Example:

1. Configure all apps in instance `awtrix-light.0`
2. Create a new instance for the second device (`awtrix-light.1`)
3. Choose `awtrix-light.0` in the instance configuration of `awtrix-light.1` to use the same apps on the second device

## Blockly and JavaScript

`sendTo` / message box can be used to

- send one time notifications (with text, sound, duration, ...)
- create a timer
- play a custom sound

### Notifications

Send a "one time" notification to your device:

```javascript
sendTo('awtrix-light', 'notification', { text: 'haus-automatisierung.com', repeat: 1, duration: 5, stack: true, wakeup: true }, (res) => {
    if (res && res.error) {
        console.error(res.error);
    }
});
```

The message object supports all available options of the firmware. See [documentation](https://blueforcer.github.io/awtrix-light/#/api?id=json-properties) for details.

*You can also use a Blockly block to send a notification (doesn't provide all available options).*

### Timer

Create a new timer (in 1 hour, 10 minutes and 5 seconds):

```javascript
sendTo('awtrix-light', 'timer', { sound: 'example', seconds: 5, minutes: 10, hours: 1 }, (res) => {
    if (res && res.error) {
        console.error(res.error);
    }
});
```

The message object supports all available options of the firmware. See [documentation](https://blueforcer.github.io/awtrix-light/#/api?id=timer) for details.

*You can also use a Blockly block to create a timer.*

### Sounds

To play a (previously created) sound file:

```javascript
sendTo('awtrix-light', 'sound', { sound: 'example' }, (res) => {
    if (res && res.error) {
        console.error(res.error);
    }
});
```

The message object supports all available options of the firmware. See [documentation](https://blueforcer.github.io/awtrix-light/#/api?id=play-a-sound) for details.

*You can also use a Blockly block to play a sound.*

## Custom apps

**App names must be lowercase (a-z) and unique. No numbers, no capital letters, no special characters, no whitespaces.**

The following names are used by internal apps and cannot be used: `time`, `eyes`, `date`, `temp`, `hum`, `bat`.

- `%s` is a placeholder for the state value
- `%u` is a placeholder for the unit of the state object (e.g. `Â°C`)

It is possible to define a custom text with those placeholders (e.g. `Outside: %s %u`).

**Custom apps just display acknowledged values! Control states with `ack: false` are ignored (to prevent duplicate requests and to ensure that values are valid / confirmed)!**

The selected state should have the data type `string` or `number`. Other tyes (like `boolean`) are also supported but raise a warning. It is recommended to use an alias state with a convert function to replace a boolean value with text (e.g. `val ? 'on' : 'off'` or `val ? 'open' : 'closed'`). See ioBroker documentation for details. *This feature is not related to this adapter.*

The following combinations will lead to a warning in the log:

- A custom app with a selected object id of a state, but `%s` is missing in the text
- A custom app with a selected object id of a state without a unit `common.unit`, but `%u` is used in the text
- A custom app without a selected object, but `%s` has been used in the text

## History apps

**App names must be lowercase (a-z) and unique. No numbers, no capital letters, no special characters, no whitespaces.**

The following names are used by internal apps and cannot be used: `time`, `eyes`, `date`, `temp`, `hum`, `bat`.

**History apps just display acknowledged history values! Control states with `ack: false` are ignored!**

## App states

- You can use the state `activate` of each app to bring that app to front
- This state has the role `button` and allows just the value `true` (everything other value will raise a warning)

## Hide custom or history apps

Each custom and history app has a state `apps.<name>.visible`. If this state is set to `false`, the app will be removed from the device and no further updates are pushed. This is useful, if a certain app should only be displayed during day time or in a given time range.

## Hide native apps

If you want to disable/hide a native app (like battery, temperature or humidity): Use the on screen menu on the device! See [documentation](https://blueforcer.github.io/awtrix-light/#/onscreen) for details.
