# Solutions and Tutorials
?> ***This is a placeholder***.<br><br> Help ioBroker and expand this article. Please note the [ioBroker Style Guide](community/styleguidedoc) so that the changes can be adopted more easily.

@@@ This is where exemplary **overarching** solutions (how to achieve which goal is easiest) and how-tos are collected.

* Tutorials for Homematic
* Tutorials for ESP (using MQQT)
* Tutorials for...
* Logic stuff (Statistics functions)
* Complex timing controls
* Analyze and solve performance problems
* ...

Suggestion: If it only affects one adapter (excluding logic adapters), then the example/solution must be in the reference documentation of the respective adapter.

In the same way, configuration examples of tested HW components could also be collected here.
